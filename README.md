# Hex-Rays Parser

Hex-Rays Parser is a Python-based tool designed to parse and analyze C-like pseudocode generated by the Hex-Rays decompiler. This project provides a robust lexer and parser implementation for processing and understanding the structure of decompiled code.

## Features

- Lexical analysis of C-like pseudocode
- Parsing of various C language constructs, including:
  - Function declarations and definitions
  - Variable declarations
  - Control flow statements (if, while, return)
  - Expressions and operators
  - Compound statements
- Support for IDA-specific pseudocode operators
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation

## Usage

To use the Hex-Rays Parser, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes:

```python
from hex_rays_parser import Parser
```

2. Create a Parser instance with your pseudocode:

```python
pseudocode = """
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    return x;
}
"""

parser = Parser(code=pseudocode)
```

3. Parse the pseudocode and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):

```python
ast = parser.parse()
```

4. Analyze and process the AST as needed.

```python
apply_changes(ast)
print(ast) # reconstructs the pseudocode
```
